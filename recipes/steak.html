            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="main">
                <li>About 45 minutes before you want to serve the steaks, unwrap from the packaging and place on a
                    plate.
                    Season
                    both sides of the steaks with salt. Allow to come up to room temperature for up to an hour.
                    Alternatively,
                    you can salt the steaks in the morning and leave them uncovered in the fridge all day. If you skip
                    the
                    advance salting, do still season the steaks immediately before cooking.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan, preferably cast-iron, over a high heat until it is hot but
                    not
                    quite smoking.</li>
                <li>When the pan is hot, add the steaks and fry for 1 minute on each side, then turn regularly until the
                    crust
                    is dark golden-brown on both sides and the inside is cooked to your liking. The thickness of the
                    steak
                    has a
                    huge impact on the cook time, but as a rough guide, a 2cm/¾in thick steak will take 3 minutes in
                    total
                    for
                    rare, 4-5 minutes in total for medium and 7-8 minutes for well done. Using a cook's thermometer is
                    the
                    most
                    reliable method - see the recipe tips for instructions.</li>
                <li>When the steak is cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan onto a warm plate and allow it to
                    rest
                    for
                    10 minutes. Do not skip the resting, as this will allow the steak to relax and it will be more
                    tender
                    and
                    juicy when served.</li>
                <li>Add the wine to the hot pan, and scrape all the sticky bits from the pan up into the wine to create
                    a
                    bit of
                    a sauce. Add in any resting juices from the plate as well. Finish the sauce with the thyme leaves
                    and a
                    bit
                    of butter.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Serve the steak, with chips if you like, and the sauce
                    poured
                    over.</li>
